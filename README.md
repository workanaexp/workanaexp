## 👩‍💻 About Me

I am a software engineer with a strong background in academic research and complex systems analysis.

Before tech, I built a career in **social sciences**, conducting large-scale research using **Python** for data extraction, cleaning, and text mining. Today, I apply the same analytical rigor to **frontend architecture** and system design.

<details>
<summary><b>What I focus on</b></summary>

- Scalable frontend architecture  
- Complex data-driven interfaces  
- State management strategies  
- Design systems and component libraries  
- Long-term maintainability  
- Technical decision trade-offs  

</details>

**I believe software should be:**  
`Structured` · `Explicit` · `Intentional` · `Sustainable`

## 🧬 My Unique Background

**🎓 PhD in Sociology** (CAPES 5 Program)

My doctoral research analyzed how Brazilian media constructed narratives about Venezuelan migration (2015–2024).

*Technically, that meant:*
- Python-based data scraping  
- Data cleaning pipelines  
- Text mining techniques  
- Large dataset processing  
- Structured qualitative analysis  

This experience shaped how I think about **systems**, **narratives**, **power structures**, **abstractions**, and **data meaning**.

> I see software systems the same way: **as structured narratives.**

## 💡 What Drives Me

I am not interested in **shallow code**.

I am interested in:
- Systems that **scale**  
- Interfaces that **communicate clearly**  
- Code that **survives time**  
- Architecture that **makes reasoning easier**  

**My long-term vision:**  
Bridging **Research depth** × **Engineering precision** × **Product impact**.
